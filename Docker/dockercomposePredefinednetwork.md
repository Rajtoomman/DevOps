If you want to use a predefined network in Docker Compose, you can do so by specifying the network name and driver in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here's an example:

Assuming you already have a Docker network named `my-custom-network` created, you can define a service in your `docker-compose.yml` file that uses this network:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  webapp:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: webapp-container
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - my-custom-network

  database:
    image: mysql:latest
    container_name: db-container
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_password
    networks:
      - my-custom-network
networks:
  my-custom-network:
    external: true
```

In this example:

1. We define two services: `webapp` and `database`.

2. Both services use the `networks` directive to specify the `my-custom-network` network.

Ensure that the `my-custom-network` is already created before you run the `docker-compose` command. You can create a custom network using the following command:

```bash
docker network create my-custom-network
```

Once the network is created, you can start the containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will create and start the `webapp-container` and `db-container` containers on the `my-custom-network` network, allowing them to communicate using the network name.

By using a predefined network, you can share it among multiple Docker Compose projects or containers, allowing for better network isolation and management.
